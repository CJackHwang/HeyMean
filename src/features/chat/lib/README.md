# Chat Feature Lib Layer

Use this directory for pure utility functions, parsers, and other logic that is tightly coupled to the chat feature but free of React/side-effects.

Examples for future extraction:
- Scroll or layout helpers specific to chat
- Message parsing utilities
- Virtualization helpers tailored to chat UI
