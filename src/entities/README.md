# Entities Layer

This directory groups domain entities that are shared across features. Each entity can expose:

- `model/` for domain types, adapters, and normalizers
- `api/` for entity-specific data access helpers
- `ui/` for lightweight display components scoped to the entity

Add new entity folders here as the codebase evolves.
