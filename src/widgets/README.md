# Widgets Layer

This directory contains cross-page composite UI blocks with business semantics, but not tied to specific pages.

Examples:
- Sidebar
- Top navigation bar
- Complex reusable panels

Widgets may depend on `features`, `entities`, and `shared`, but features should not depend on widgets.
